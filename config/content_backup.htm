<h2>
 setspace
</h2>
<p>
 <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/setspace">
  https://ctan.org/pkg/setspace
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 Provides support for setting the spacing between lines in a document. Package options include singlespacing, onehalfspacing, and doublespacing. Alternatively the spacing can be changed as required with the \singlespacing, \onehalfspacing, and \doublespacing commands. Other size spacings also available.

<p>
 The enumerate package allows you to control the display of the enumeration counter. The package adds an optional parameter to the enumerate environment, which is used to specify the layout of the labels. The layout parameter contains an enumeration type (1 for arabic numerals, a or A for alphabetic enumeration, and i or I for Roman numerals), and things to act as decoration of the enumeration. So, for example

<h2>
 amsfonts
</h2>
<p>
 <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/amsfonts">
  https://ctan.org/pkg/amsfonts
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 An extended set of fonts for use in mathematics, including: extra mathematical symbols; blackboard bold letters (uppercase only); fraktur letters; subscript sizes of bold math italic and bold Greek letters; subscript sizes of large symbols such as sum and product; added sizes of the Computer Modern small caps font; cyrillic fonts (from the University of Washington); Euler mathematical fonts. All fonts are provided as Adobe Type 1 files, and all except the Euler fonts are provided as METAFONT source.
</p>
<p>
 The distribution also includes the canonical Type 1 versions of the Computer Modern family of fonts.
</p>
<p>
 Basic LATEX support for the symbol fonts is provided by amsfonts.sty, with names of individual symbols defined in amssymb.sty. The Euler fonts are supported by separate packages; details can be found in the documentation.

<h2>
 geometry
</h2>
<p>
 <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/geometry">
  https://ctan.org/pkg/geometry
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 The package provides an easy and flexible user interface to customize page layout, implementing auto-centering and auto-balancing mechanisms so that the users have only to give the least description for the page layout. For example, if you want to set each margin 2cm without header space, what you need is just \usepackage[margin=2cm,nohead]{geometry}.
</p>
<p>
 The package knows about all the standard paper sizes, so that the user need not know what the nominal ‘real’ dimensions of the paper are, just its standard name (such as a4, letter, etc.).
</p>
<p>
 An important feature is the package’s ability to communicate the paper size it’s set up to the output (whether via DVI \specials or via direct interaction with pdf(LA)TEX).
</p>
<h2>
 graphicx
</h2>
<p>
 <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/graphicx">
  https://ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 The package builds upon the graphics package, providing a key-value interface for optional arguments to the \includegraphics command. This interface provides facilities that go far beyond what the graphics package offers on its own.
</p>
<p>
 For extended documentation, see epslatex.
</p>
<p>
 The package is part of the latex-graphics bundle, which is one of the collections in the LATEX ‘required’ set of packages.
</p>
<h2>
 hyperref
</h2>
<p>
 <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/hyperref">
  https://ctan.org/pkg/hyperref
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 The hyperref package is used to handle cross-referencing commands in LATEX to produce hypertext links in the document. The package provides backends for the \special set defined for HyperTEX DVI processors; for embedded pdfmark commands for processing by Acrobat Distiller (dvips and Y&amp;Y’s dvipsone); for Y&amp;Y’s dviwindo; for PDF control within pdfTEX and dvipdfm; for TEX4ht; and for VTEX’s pdf and HTML backends.
</p>
<p>
 The package is distributed with the backref and nameref packages, which make use of the facilities of hyperref.
</p>
<p>
 The package depends on the author’s kvoptions, ltxcmds and refcount packages.
</p>
<h2>
 textpos
</h2>
<p>
 <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/textpos">
  https://ctan.org/pkg/textpos
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 A package to facilitate placement of boxes at absolute positions on the LATEX page. There are several reasons why this might be useful, an important one being to help the creation of large-format conference posters.
</p>
<h2>
 titlesec
</h2>
<p>
 <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/titlesec">
  https://ctan.org/pkg/titlesec
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 A package providing an interface to sectioning commands for selection from various title styles. E.g., marginal titles and to change the font of all headings with a single command, also providing simple one-step page styles. Also includes a package to change the page styles when there are floats in a page. You may assign headers/footers to individual floats, too.
</p>
<h2>
 type1cm
</h2>
<p>
 <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/type1cm">
  https://ctan.org/pkg/type1cm
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 LATEX, by default, restricts the sizes at which you can use its default computer modern fonts, to a fixed set of discrete sizes (effectively, a set specified by Knuth). The type1cm package removes this restriction; this is particularly useful when using scalable versions of the cm fonts (Bakoma, or the versions from BSR/Y&amp;Y, or True Type versions from Kinch, PCTEX, etc.). In fact, since modern distributions will automatically generate any bitmap font you might need, type1cm has wider application than just those using scaleable versions of the fonts.
</p>
<p>
 Note that the LATEX distribution now contains a package fix-cm, which performs the task of type1cm, as well as doing the same job for T1- and TS1-encoded ec fonts.
